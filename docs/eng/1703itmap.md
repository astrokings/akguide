## Sector

A sector is a space in which the entire Interspace is classified into a development zone of a certain size, and each region is given a unique name.

A sector usually consists of 15 to 30 bases, and the line connecting these bases becomes a route through which the fleet can move.

Most of the bases in a sector are occupiable targets, and in particular, ownership of the entire sector is determined by the occupation status of the Citadel, which is an important stronghold.

In other words, ownership of a sector can be acquired by capturing all citadels within the sector.


## Base

A base is an area with a radius of 13 cells centered on a building usually called a 'lighthouse' where the fleet can anchor.

All bases are linked to adjacent bases, and fleets can only move along the linked adjoining bases.

Each base can be captured by defeating the defense fleet stationed in the central lighthouse building.


## Base Building

### Outpost

As the most basic unit base, it can receive support from up to 3 defense fleets.<br>
Usually, the purpose of occupying this base is to secure a movement path.



### Citadel

It is a key point in determining ownership of the entire sector.<br>
The ownership of the sector changes as soon as all citadels in the sector are captured.

You can receive support from up to 8 defense fleets.


### Gate

The long-distance base that connects each of the sectors.<br>
To get to another sector, you have to go through a connecting gate.

Gates cannot be captured individually and will change with full sector ownership when all Citadels are captured.

Immediately after a sector move, the expedition is temporarily subject to a movement waiting time.


### Capital

The Capital is the center of your faction and is a protected area that cannot be invaded by enemy forces.<br>
The Capital is where the departure, return, and supply of the expedition takes place.

The expedition can immediately return to the Capital at any time.

You can move to sectors owned by your Faction using the long-distance jump.


## Sector Status

### Neutral

It is in a neutral state if it is not occupied by any faction.<br>
It remains neutral until all Citadels in the sector are captured.

### Occupied

A certain faction has captured all Citadels in a sector.<br>
It can be occupied by other factions in adjacent sectors at any time.

### Invasion

Another faction has infiltrated a sector owned by a certain faction.<br>
Invasion status is maintained for 4 hours after status change.<br>
After defending all Citadels for 4 hours in the Invasion state, the state changes to a Protected state<br>
If more than one faction owns the Citadel within the time limit, the sector's ownership is changed to neutral.

### Protected

If you block an enemy invasion, you get 4 hours of protection, and defense fleets at all bases are automatically restored.<br>
No other faction can invade protected sectors.


## Expedition Base Movement

The expedition can only move to the base occupied by the faction to which it belongs.<br>
However, if there is a deployed fleet or support in the expedition, it is impossible to move.

Immediately after the expedition moves, the move waiting time is applied according to the following rules.
- Occupied or Protected Status: 10 seconds + traveled base x 10 seconds
- Invasion or Neutral Status: 180 seconds + traveled base x 30 seconds


## Defense Fleet
![](https://d3bbxo4nelobc3.cloudfront.net/html/img/help/1703_07.jpg)

A basic level of defense fleet is deployed in occupied sectors.<br>
The defensive fleet can increase its level through reinforcement (supply function). (Daily Limit 3 times)

If the base is occupied by other forces, the level of the defense fleet will be changed to Lv.1.<br>
When a sector becomes protected, the number of defending fleets is restored to their maximum.
