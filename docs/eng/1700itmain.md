[Interspace] was originally the first hideout for humans to escape from the grip of the extraterrestrial force, CRUX.

​
In contrast to the normal outer space, this is filled with gas and atypical dark matter, making it impossible to navigate normally which was a suitable hiding place against the alien forces. However, it was a place similar to an evacuation fortress that required much more effort in terms of development.

​
As humanity continues to develop, it naturally emerged from this refuge and expanded its power to the surrounding galaxy until Emperor Banon abandoned his position and lost its status as the capital of the empire.<Interspace> was the home for the second generation of humans, who carried out the migration, and was the center of the realm of humanity.

Also, in A.D.3450, the massive invasion of the CRUX, where all humanity was connected through the Tenebris, faced a complete severance.<br>
However, mankind has made great efforts to reclaim the <Interspace> that is like home, and now the restoration is near.

The reason humanity has made efforts to restore <Interspace> is not just the economic benefits that can be obtained there.<br>
Humanity paid attention to the need to unite as one human being beyond the current state of isolation in order to more effectively counter the alien force Crux.

Now, humanity will meet again here and enter the race to claim the legacy of our ancestors first.
