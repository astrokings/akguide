## 1)Conquest Points

 The total Conquest Points of a Federation is calculated by its membersâ€™ PvP results.

Conquest Point is an indication of the dominance of a Federation. At the end of each season, Federations are generously rewarded by the amount of Conquest Points accumulated.

Resources received this way are distributed to Federation Members by the Federation Leader. The ratio of distribution is determined by ***<u>Federation Contribution</u>*** and cannot be changed.
