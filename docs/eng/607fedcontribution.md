# Federation Contribution 

 Federation Members may contribute to their Federation in many ways. Whenever their Contribution increases, they receive Federation Marks.

Contribution is calculated by the amount of activities in recent 30 days. It is not reset when you leave your Federation.

You can purchase items at the [***<u>Federation Store</u>***](eng/105tradingpost#Federation-Store) with these Federation Marks. They do not disappear even when you leave your current Federation.

  (double points if donated on the recommended project)
