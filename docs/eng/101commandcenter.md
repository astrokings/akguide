# National Policy

### 1)Select National Policy

 You can set the general direction of planetary improvements by selecting a National Policy. Each policy offers two opposite options. If you select either, the items from the other cannot be accessed until National Policy is reset.

Once you decided a National Policy, you can enforce sub policies for buffs. Enforcing a policy costs some Policy Points.

# Council

 The five councils each have a specialized effect, of which power increases as the number of Heroes assigned to the respective council increases.

<br>

### 1)Improving Council

 Each council can be improved by assigning more Heroes to it.

Select a council and then a Hero to assign to that council. You can assign multiple Heroes at once.

<font color="red">**Note: Heroes assigned to a council can never become active again. They are effectively retired.**</font>
