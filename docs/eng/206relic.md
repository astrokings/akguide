# Ship Relic Circuit


***Basic information on Relic Circuits has been discovered in each region of Interspace. As a result of researching artifacts based on this, we have completed a new artifact - “Relic Circuit” - A Ship Relic Circuit.***

***By injecting a huge amount of energy into the Relic Circuit, a new relic circuit is formed. When this is combined with the ship enhancement system, the stats of all the ships it belongs to are further increased. Unfortunately, the schematic generated by the Relic Circuit cannot be controlled yet, it may take multiple tries to get the relic that you want. Instead, the more you try, the bigger your Relic Circuit will expand.***

***New relics are given names based on where they were discovered, and many explorers are trying to find information about relics that have not yet been discovered.***

Ship Relic Circuit unlocks at Ship Enhancement Facility Level 25.

# Relic Circuit

The relic circuit consists of up to 9 relics.<br>
The three basic slots are unlocked for the relic circuit, and if you engrave it a certain number of times, the level of the relic circuit increases.<br>
As the relic circuit's level rises, the number of relic and lock slots increases.

# Relic

A relic is a special item that is engraved on the relic circuit and has a dedicated normal ship stat.<br>
One relic has a grade from 1 to 10, and the higher the grade, the higher the applied stats.<br>
When applied, the ship enhancement level is required, and if the ship enhancement level is insufficient, only half of the stats will be applied.

# Engrave

When engraving with a black stone, a new relic is engraved in all slots placed in the relic circuit.<br>
If you use the black stone to engrave, a new relic will be engraved in all Relic Circuit slots.<br>
When you tap a relic, the relic is locked, and even if engraved, it will remain.<br>
The number of black stones required for engraving increases according to the number of locked relics.<br>

Black Stones can be obtained from the Empire Arena Merit Shop or the Interspace Faction Shop.<br>
In addition to black stone, you can use crystals to engrave. When engraving using crystals, you can engrave up to 10 times per day for each relic circuit.

# Equipping Relic Circuit

In the ship enhancement slot, a button to equip the relic circuit is available at the bottom right of each ship. The relic circuit must be equipped to apply the relic effect.<br>
If you touch the Equip button, the Change Ship Relic Circuit page opens, and you can equip and recall the Relic Circuit .<br>
The relic's 'equip' button displays the name of the currently equipped relic circuit.<br>

# Overload

The overload effect can be used when the relic circuit reaches level 10.<br>
The overload effect maintains the selected relic's grade and can be engraved with a new relic. (The same kind of relic might appear.)<br>
To use the overload feature, the overload gauge must be fully charged.

<br><br>

# Relic Circuit Effect

The level of relic circuit is determined based on the sum of the grades of the relic engraved on the relic circuit, and the effect is activated for each level.<br>
It is applied based on the highest relic circuit level reached, and it is applied even if the relic circuit is not equipped.

# Relic Grade & Probability Information

| Grade | # of Relics <br>By Grade | Probability of Imprint<br>Per Grade |  Probability of Imprint<br>Per Individual Relic  |
| - | - | - | - |
| Ⅰ | 60 | 45.00% | 0.7500% |
| Ⅱ | 60 | 41.00% | 0.6833% |
| Ⅲ | 60 | 11.50% | 0.1917% |
| Ⅳ | 60 | 1.780% | 0.0297% |
| Ⅴ | 60 | 0.480% | 0.0080% |
| Ⅵ | 60 | 0.100% | 0.0017% |
| Ⅶ | 60 | 0.062% | 0.0010% |
| Ⅷ | 60 | 0.042% | 0.0007% |
| Ⅸ | 60 | 0.022% | 0.0004% |
| Ⅹ | 60 | 0.014% | 0.0002% |

※ The engraving probability for each individual relic is a number rounded to the 5th decimal place, and the sum of the indicated probabilities may not equal 100% due to the rounded number, but the actual sum of the individual probabilities is 100%.
