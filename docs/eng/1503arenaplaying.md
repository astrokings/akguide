# Gameplay


## Matching

Tap the MATCH button located on the main page of the Empire Arena to enter the Matching List page.<br>

The matching page selects 5 potential opponents and displays them as a list. 
 - Matching opponents are randomly selected among the other commanders participating in the Empire Arena, with the most similar targets based on their ranking and combat power.<br>

Matching list can be refreshed for free every 4 hours.
 - Refreshing the list using crystals is also possible.
 - If you won against all the matching targets on your list, the list will be updated for free.<br>

In the Silver and Bronze levels, if the number of matching people is insufficient, NPC targets may be matched.
 - At other higher levels, you must wait for the minimum number of players required to participate.<br>


## Battle

Upon entering the battlefield, a total of 6 fleets will be deployed, 3 fleets for each side.<br>
In a 1:1 battle between fleets, the side with the highest number of victory wins the match.<br>

### Fleet Deployment
At the same time as deployment, the time gauge increases according to the number of Tactic Operation for each fleet.<br>
A fleet with full gauge gets priority to choose which enemy fleet to attack.<br>

### Select Fleet to Attack
The fleet that has gained priority selects an opponent's fleet and begins the battle.<br>
The time provided to select is 60 seconds. If the enemy fleet was not selected within the time frame, the nearest opponent fleet will be automatically selected.<br>

### Battle Round
Each fleet receives additional effects based on the weekly arena setting.<br>
Each fleet receives an additional effect depending on the effect of the selected command formation.<br>
Battles are conducted in 1:1 fleet battles, and the outcome of the battle determines the victory or defeat of the round.<br>

### Fast Battle
If you activate the 'Fast Battle' function, a simplified battle will proceed.<br>
When the 'Fast Battle' function is enabled, the fleet commander skills will be automatically used.<br>
If a battle is already in progress, it will be applied from the next round.<br>
