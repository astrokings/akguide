#### Matching Score

The national power of participating members is converted into matching scores according to internal rules and used for matching.<br>
The total of the converted matching scores determines the opposing federation.<br>
<br>
- To ensure a fair matching, the higher the national power, the more points are added to the matching score.<br>
- If the number of registered participants, including reserve members, exceeds 20, the matching scores of only 20 participants  in order of national power will be included in the calculation.

#### Imperial Federation War Matching

After the end of the registration period, matching will be held on a Friday based on UTC.<br>
When matching is complete, you can check the determined match time and some of the opponent's federation information.<br>
Hidden information about the opponent federations will be revealed during the battle waiting period.<br>
During this period, each federation must prepare for the Federation War battle.

#### Alpha Team / Delta Team
The Alpha Team, which starts from the bottom left of the Federation's battlefield, and the Delta Team, which starts from the top right, are randomly determined during the matching phase.<br>
When the matching is complete, you can check the teams of each federation.

#### Prevent Consecutive Matching of the Same Federation

An federation will not be consecutively matched with the federation it faced in the previous federation battle.<br>
However, in situations where there is a shortage of potential match-ups and the match is at risk of cancellation, consecutive matches may occur.<br>
