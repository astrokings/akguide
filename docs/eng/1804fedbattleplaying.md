Federation points and individual points can be obtained by capturing bases.<br>
In the case of some bases, beneficial buffs are applied to all federation members when captured.

If you successfully capture a base by attacking it for a set amount of time, you will occupy the base.

<br>

### â€» Captured/Occupied State
- Captured
  - The attack on the base was successful, and the base was captured.
  - You must maintain this state for 2 minutes to successfully capture the base.
  - Points cannot be earned while in this state.
- Occupied
  - The base has been successfully captured for 2 minutes and is completely occupied.
  - First occupation and occupation maintenance points can be acquired only when the base is occupied.

<br>
<br>
<br>


## Federation Point

Federation Points can be obtained as follows.

- The federation that first captures each base receives the first occupation points.<br>
- If you occupy a base, you will receive an occupation maintenance point every minute.

Not only does victory or defeat depend on the number of federation points earned, but the higher the points, the more rewards are given, so all participants must do their best to earn federation points.

<br>
<br>
<br>


## Individual Point

Here's how to earn individual points.
 
- The first user to capture each base will receive the first occupation points.<br>
  In the case of a rally attack, points are awarded evenly.<br><br>
- Occupation maintenance points are acquired every minute when a base is captured.<br>
  All users who dispatched a defense fleet to the base receive points.<br><br>
- Attack bases or planets of hostile users to earn points according to the combat power of the opponent.<br>
  In the case of a rally attack, points are distributed according to the combat power ratio.<br><br>
- When defending a base or friendly planet, you earn points according to the combat power of the opponent you reduced.<br>
  If there are multiple defending fleets, points are distributed according to their combat power ratio.

| Situation | Reduce Combat Power | Earn Individual Point |
| - | - | - |
| When attacking base or planet | 800,000 | 1 |
| When defending base or planet | 3,200,000 | 1 |

The higher the individual point acquisition, the more rewards are given.
