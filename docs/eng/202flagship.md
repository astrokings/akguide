# Build Flagship & Repair

### 1)Build Flagship

 Flagships are for fleet Commanders and you can have only one per type. As you upgrade the facility, you can build more Flagships. 

However, the number of available Flagships are very limited.

### 2)Flagship Limits and Scrapping

 As you upgrade the facility, you can build more Flagships. However, the number of Flagships you can have at a time is always less than the number of available Flagship types.

This means you cannot have all types of Flagships at the same time. If necessary, you need to scrap existing Flagships to make room for different type of Flagships. You get only a fraction of the resources back when you scrapping Flagships though.

While resources are partially refunded, you retain the equipment that were on the scrapped Flagship.

### 3)Damaged Flagship and Repairing

 Unlike normal ships, Flagships cannot be destroyed. When your Flagship is severely damaged, it cannot be deployed until it is repaired.

If you win an encounter, your Flagship is not destroyed.

# Upgrade Flagship

### 1)Flagship Level

 As Flagships gain levels, their basic stats improve. You need [Upgrade Modules] to increase the level of a Flagship.

There are six types of Upgrade Modules, from V1 to V6. Higher the module number, the more effective its upgrading capacity becomes.

### 2)Flagship Tier

 When a Flagship reaches its maximum level, it can be further improved by increasing its tier, which unlocks additional levels, adds more Special Device slots, or grants extra Command Buffs.

The materials needed to promote a Flagship depends on the type and tier of the Flagship. You can check the necessary materials from the Promote Flagship screen.

### 3)Command Buff

 Command Buff is a unique ability of a Flagship. It affects entire fleet, and up to two Command Buffs are available as you promote your Flagship.

Command Buff can be upgraded by using [Buff Upgrade Modules]. However, as you upgrade the buff, it will less likely succeed when upgrading further.

### 4)Flagship Device

 There has been numerous attempts to customize the Flagship devices throughout the galaxy. It is only a matter of time before someone comes up with modular system for customization.

You can sometimes acquire devices for your Flagships when defeating wanted criminals as a loot.

The lootable devices are as follows:

- Weapon: Increases the Attack Power of the Flagship.
- Armor: Increases the Resistance of the Flagship.
- Engine: Increases the Mobility and Evasion of the Flagship.
- Special Device: Adds a variety of additional abilities to the Flagship.
