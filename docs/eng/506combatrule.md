# Battle Rules


## Battle-related ship stats


### 1) Attack Power

This is the base stat of the damage you can deal with depending on the opponent's weapon.<br>


### 2) Range

The range is based on the ship weapon's range. For targets outside the range, it will move the target into the range and attack.<br>


### 3) Attack Speed

The ability to determine how many attacks can be made per turn or attack.<br>
The faster the attack speed, the more attacks can be made and could cause intense damage in a limited period of time.<br>


### 4) Accuracy and Evasion

The target hit rate is calculated with the attacker's fleet accuracy against the defender's fleet evasion that affects the damage caused by the attack.<br>
When the fleet's accuracy is higher than the target's evasion, it gives more damage to the target.<br>


### 5) Penetrate and Resistance

With the penetration of the attacker's fleet and the resistance of the defender's fleet, depending on the difference in value, it affects the damage result caused by the attack.<br>
When the fleet's penetration is higher than the target's resistance, it gives more damage to the target.<br>


### 6) Critical Chance 

Critical Chance Rate refers to the percentage of the critical strikes that occur during an attack. Critical Damage refers to the multiplier of damage that occurs when a critical strike happened.<br>
The higher the critical chance rate, the higher the chance for the enemy's ships to receive critical hits. The higher the critical damage, the greater damage can be dealt with the enemy's ships.<br> 


### 7) Durability

Durability refers to the fleet's strength that determines how much damage it can bear.<br>
When the damage exceeds durability, the fleet will retreat, and some of the ships that retreat could be damaged or destroyed when the battle ends.<br>
When the fleet has higher durability, it can hold the opponent's attack longer, as a result, it can reduce damage rate.
