## Deploy Fleet Conditions	

To deploy a fleet, it must be located in the occupied area of the expedition and must consist of one flagship and at least 1,000 ships.	
	
The target point to which the expedition can be sent is limited to the base where the expedition is located and adjacent to it. You can't send a fleet any farther.	

The expedition can deploy/support up to 3 fleets.	

The rallying fleet consists of up to 8 fleets.	

The expedition's fleet slot operates separately from the planet's fleet slot.	
	
	
## Expedition Battle	

Expedition can not only attack a single fleet but also attack together with members of the same faction.<br>
However, all expeditions participating in the rally must be located on the same base.

When the expedition is isolated between enemy sectors, attack power -80%, resistance -80%, evasion -80% stats decrease.	

	
## Base Battle	

When a base battle occurs, the defending side fights in such a way that each support fleet and NPC defense fleet participate in the defensive battle once.

In order to occupy the base, you must destroy all the fleets stationed on the defending side. (Win all battles with individual defense fleets)	

	
## Support Fleet	

Fleet support to other expeditions is possible with a maximum of 7 participants.

A friendly capture point can consist of up to 8 fleets (a total of 64 fleets) as a defensive fleet depending on the type of point.

The defending fleet that supported the base will return to the expedition if the battle is lost.

	
## Expedition Unable to Battle	

If there is no flagship available to deploy due to damage to the flagship or the total number of ships of the expedition is less than 1,000, it is classified as incapable of combat.	

If the number of available ships is less than 1000, it is classified as annihilated.<br>
the state of annihilation of the expedition, if it is defeated by an additional attack, it is forcibly returned to the capital.
