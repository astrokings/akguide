# Empire Arena

E.M.U. resumes the virtual training system that was previously operated by the headquarter of the Empire of Thetmes to enhance the combat power of human planets and prepare them against the attack of the disturbing alien forces CRUX.<br>
Empire Arena supports fleet warfare training in a virtual space based on real fleet data.<br>
One-on-one battles will take place with the opponent of your choice in the virtual battlefield, and the two sides each operate three fleets with a total of three battles, and the side with the highest number of victory wins the match.<br>
All commanders are eligible to participate in the Empire Arena on a certain level.<br>
To encourage active participation, along with the competition system, the Merchant Union (E.M.U.) has added significant rewards that could greatly help commanders boost their power.<br>
