# Expedition	
![](https://astrokings.s3.ap-northeast-2.amazonaws.com/html/img/help/1702_01.jpg)

The expedition consists of several flagships, ships, and heroes, and all activities in the Interspace are centered on the expedition.	
	
	
## Formation	
	
The minimum conditions for forming an expedition to participate in Interspace are as follows.	
	
- 2 or more T5 or higher flagships	
- 1000 or more T8 ships

As the level of research related to the expedition increases, the number of flagships that can be organized and the size of the ships increase.<br>
	
There is no limit to the formation of heroes, and the crew members on the flagship are automatically included in the expedition team when participating in Interspace.	
	
Among the flagships included in the expedition, the first flagship is automatically designated as the carrier and serves as the representative and defense flagship of the expedition.<br>
The carrier can be changed at any time in the Fellowship Flagship Settings screen.	
	
	
## Participation (Entry to Interspace)	
	
To complete the formation and send the expedition to Interspace, a certain amount of resources must be paid as a navigation fee.<br>
If there is a federation that occupies Tenebris, a certain amount of the navigation cost paid will be attributed to the federation resources.<br>
However, if the federation you belong to has occupied Tenebris, the navigation fee is free.	
	
Immediately after payment of the navigation fee, the entire expedition departs from the planet and moves to Tenebris for a certain period of time.<br>
Flagship is displayed on the universe map while moving and set as a carrier	
	
The expedition cannot return until reaching Tenebris and will enter the Interspace after the travel time has elapsed.	
	
	
## Expedition activities after participation	
	
The expedition that enters the Interspace is located in the Capital sector of the faction to which it belongs.	
	
Expedition can only move to bases occupied by their faction.<br>
The expedition can only move when all the fleets that are deployed or sent for reinforcement have returned.	
	
If a flagship or ship is damaged, it can be repaired only by moving the expedition to the capital or a sector occupied by its own faction.	
	
	
### Deploy Fleet

The flagship, ships, and heroes of the expedition can be organized into a fleet to attack a specific base or the expedition of an enemy force.

To deploy a fleet, it must be located in the occupied area of the expedition, and the fleet must consist of one flagship and at least 1,000  ships.	
	
	
### Supply and Planet Return
![](https://astrokings.s3.ap-northeast-2.amazonaws.com/html/img/help/1702_03.jpg)<br>
	
You can supply additional flagships, ships, and heroes waiting on your planet through the Interspace within the expedition formation limit.<br>
Once the supply starts, it takes 1 hour to complete, and when the supply is complete, it will be temporarily placed at the supply station within the Capital base. 	
	
If you want to change the arrangement between the fleet in the supply depot and the expedition, you must first move (return) the expedition to the capital base location.	
	
You can check the status of the fleet deployed to the supply depot through the capital base or the faction's [Capital Depot].<br>
Also, you can return as many fleets as you want back to your planet if you're left in the supply post.	
	
	
## Annihilation and Disbandment	
	
### Annihilation	
	
During Interspace activities, the expedition is considered annihilated if the following conditions occur:	

- When all the flagships of the expedition are damaged	
- When the number of ships that can be deployed in the expedition is less than 1000

When annihilated, the expedition is immediately forced to move to the capital sector of the faction it belongs to.<br>
In the state of annihilation, movement outside the Capital Sector is not possible.
	
### Disbandment	
	
If you leave a faction you belong to, all fleets in the expedition and Capital Depot will be disbanded and will immediately return to your planet.

When the expedition's assigned ships return to the planet, all the ship units that exceed the capacity of the Space Dock will be discarded.<br>
However, E.M.U. will issue ship purchase order items to 10% of the discarded units.


## Long-distance travel

It is energized by the capital and moves to the target sector in one step.

This can only be used if the expedition is located in the Capital.<br>
Movement is possible only when the target sector is occupied and protected by the faction it belongs to, and long-distance movement is possible only when the movement path is safe.

Move latency is added by 2 minutes per move sector.<br>
It is moved to a movable position among several gates present in the target sector.
