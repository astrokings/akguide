# Expedition	
![](https://d3bbxo4nelobc3.cloudfront.net/html/img/help/1702_01_fix.jpg)

The expedition consists of several flagships, ships, and heroes, and all activities in the Interspace are centered on the expedition.	
	
	
## Formation	
	
The minimum conditions for forming an expedition to participate in Interspace are as follows.	
	
- 2 or more T5 or higher flagships	
- 1000 or more T8 ships

As the level of research related to the expedition increases, the number of flagships that can be organized and the size of the ships increase.<br>
	
There is no limit to the formation of heroes, and the crew members on the flagship are automatically included in the expedition team when participating in Interspace.	
	
Among the flagships included in the expedition, the first flagship is automatically designated as the carrier and serves as the representative and defense flagship of the expedition.<br>
The carrier can be changed at any time in the Fellowship Flagship Settings screen.	
	
	
## Participation (Entry to Interspace)	
	
To complete the formation and send the expedition to Interspace, a certain amount of resources must be paid as a navigation fee.<br>
If there is a federation that occupies Tenebris, a certain amount of the navigation cost paid will be attributed to the federation resources.<br>
However, if the federation you belong to has occupied Tenebris, the navigation fee is free.	
	
Immediately after payment of the navigation fee, the entire expedition departs from the planet and moves to Tenebris for a certain period of time.<br>
Flagship is displayed on the universe map while moving and set as a carrier	
	
The expedition cannot return until reaching Tenebris and will enter the Interspace after the travel time has elapsed.	
	
	
## Expedition activities after participation	
	
The expedition that enters the Interspace is located in the Capital sector of the faction to which it belongs.	
	
Expedition can only move to bases occupied by their faction.<br>
The expedition can only move when all the fleets that are deployed or sent for reinforcement have returned.	
	
If a flagship or ship is damaged, it can be repaired only by moving the expedition to the capital or a sector occupied by its own faction.	
	
	
### Deploy Fleet

The flagship, ships, and heroes of the expedition can be organized into a fleet to attack a specific base or the expedition of an enemy force.

To deploy a fleet, it must be located in the occupied area of the expedition, and the fleet must consist of one flagship and at least 1,000  ships.	
	
	
### Deploy and Return Fleet

You can instantly place idle flagships, non-ships and heroes from home planet to the expedition however, they cannot exceed the size of the expedition.<br>

To change the fleet setup, the expedition must be placed in the Capital, and a small cost will be required.<br>

Heroes and flagships of the expedition can be returned to home planet only when they are not damaged or being repaired.
	
	
## Annihilation and Disbandment	
	
### Annihilation	
	
During Interspace activities, the expedition is considered annihilated if the following conditions occur:	

- When the number of ships that can be deployed in the expedition is less than 1000

When annihilated, the expedition is immediately forced to move to the capital sector of the faction it belongs to.<br>
In the state of annihilation, movement outside the Capital Sector is not possible.
	
### Disbandment	
	
The entire forces of the expedition will be dismissed and returned to home planet instantly when you leave the Faction.

When the expedition's assigned ships return to the planet, all the ship units that exceed the capacity of the Space Dock will be discarded.<br>
However, E.M.U. will issue ship purchase order items to 10% of the discarded units.


## Long-distance travel

It receives energy from the Capital and moves to the target sector at once.

It can only be used if the expedition is located in the Capital.<br>
It can only move if the patch of movement from the Capital to the target sector is safe.

Move latency is added by 2 minutes per move sector.
