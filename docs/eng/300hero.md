### 2)Facility Administrator

 You can appoint an administrator for each building on your planet. Administrators unlock and boost additional features of the buildings assigned to them.

Heroes with Admin Skills confer additional bonuses when they are assigned as an administrator.

<br>

### 3)Fleet Commander

 Heroes can be assigned as a fleet commander for combat, harvesting, or defense duties.

You can manually assign the commander when you deploy a fleet. It is much easier if you pre-set your fleet commanders at the Space Dock.

<br>

### 4)Hero Tier

 Heroes come in four different tiers. The tier of a hero determines their maximum level and skills.

<br>

### 5)Hero Skills

 There are two sets of skills: Combat Skills and Admin Skills. Combat Skills are used in combat, while Admin Skills are used while developing the planet. Passive combat skills are automatically used, while active combat skills need to be manually used.

Hero Skills can be improved with [New-type Skill Elements].

S Grade heroes can use [Advanced Skill Element] to upgrade their specialized skills.

### 6)Hero Dismissal and Council

 You can dismiss unnecessary Heroes. If you have the Council, you can alternatively appoint them to the Council to boost their effects.

### 7)Lock Hero

 You can lock a Hero to prevent them from being accidentally dismissed or assigned to the Council.
