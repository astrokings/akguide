### Facility Administrator
#### (1) Minister
You can appoint your heroes as ministers at facilities on the planet.<br>
The **"Admin Bonus"**, which is unique to each facility, is activated for each facility that has appointed a minister, and the effect increases depending on the appointed minister's admin ability.<br>
A hero appointed as a minister will have their **"Minister Exclusive Skills"** activated..<br>
However, if there is no vice minister appointed to the facility, the **"Vice Minister Exclusive Skills"** possessed by the minister will also be activated.

<br>
<br>

#### (2) Vice Minister
If each facility on the planet is level 30 or higher, you can appoint a hero you own as vice minister.
Heroes appointed as vice ministers will have their **"Vice Minister Exclusive Skills"** activated.
While the vice minister is appointed, all skill effects of the vice minister are not applied to facilities where a minister has not been appointed.

### Fleet Commander

Heroes can be assigned as a fleet commander for combat, harvesting, or defense duties.

You can manually assign the commander when you deploy a fleet. It is much easier if you pre-set your fleet commanders at the Space Dock.

In the case of the minigame, the fleet commander can be designated directly when deploying, but cannot be assigned from the space dock.

### Hero Grade
Heroes are classified into four grades, and the following abilities vary depending on the hero’s grade.
- Max level
- Max number of enhancements
  - Each time a hero is enhanced, a random skill among the hero's skills is enhanced, and each skill can be enhanced up to 3 times.
  - For every 3 enhancements, a star (★) is added to the hero, and the hero's max level limit increases by 5.
- Number of skills
| Hero Grade | Max Level | Max # of Enhancements | # of Skills | Minigame Attack Power & Durability |
