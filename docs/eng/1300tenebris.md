# Tenebris Battle

Tenebris is a huge artificial structure located in the dark zones of each galaxy. It is a large scale of warp gate created during the golden age of the Tetmes period.<br>
It had an important role in providing warp points that could transfer to the empire's territory -other galaxies, with the characteristics of the dark zone.<br>
Because it was made in the Tetmes era that has been lost, we have to get the Tenebris from CRUX, which can not be rebuilt now.<br>
E.M.U. and the entire galaxies are watching who will be the Federation to defeat numerous competitors and regain Tenebris and reconnect the Galaxy.<br>

### 1) Time and Info

![](http://d3bbxo4nelobc3.cloudfront.net/html/img/help/1300_02.jpg)

The battle starts at  UTC (Saturday) and will be held for 8 hours once every 4 weeks. <br>

Commanders will fight to take control of Tenebris and the 6 satellites.
6 satellites will serve as the bridgeheads for the Tenebris and can only be owned by one Federation.<br>

If you win the battle, you will take control of the Tenebris and the 6 satellites in which you could receive various benefits, rewards, and function.<br>



### 2) How to Win

![](http://d3bbxo4nelobc3.cloudfront.net/html/img/help/1300_03.jpg)

The Federation which charges all the energy needed to run Tenebris wins the battle.<br>

The energy charge is divided into 5 stages when enough energy is collected, it will progress to the next stage.<br>
Energy is charged when you maintain the Tenebris occupation.<br>
When you take control of Tenebris, 1 energy point is charged per minute.<br>

 - Stage 1: 10 Points (Required Time: 10min/Accumulated Time: 10min)
 - Stage 2: 15 Points (Required Time: 15min/Accumulated Time:: 25min)
 - Stage 3: 20 Points (Required Time: 20min/Accumulated Time: 45min)
 - Stage 4: 120 Points (Required Time: 30min/Accumulated Time: 1hr 15min)
 - Stage 5: 150 Points (Required Time: 45min/Accumulated Time: 2hrs)<br>


If a Federation captured the Tenebris during your occupation, the energy charge stage will be maintained. <br>
However, the energy point that was charged during the stage will be reset. 

All charged energy point records will be accumulated and the rankings will be determined by the energy charge level and the accumulated energy point record. 
 In the absence of a winner, the Federation with the highest level and accumulated points will take control of Tenebris. <br>




### 3) Attack

![](http://d3bbxo4nelobc3.cloudfront.net/html/img/help/1300_04.jpg)

Tenebris and satellites cannot be scouted.<br>

Attack Type: Rally<br>

If the rally attack wins against the defense fleet, the attacker’s Federation will take over the target.<br>

At the start of the battle, the NPC defense fleet will be defending Tenebris and its satellites.<br>

In order to attack Tenebris, your federation has to occupy at least one satellite.<br>

You can only occupy satellites equal to the Tenebris charge level achieved by your Federation.<br>



### 4) Defense

![](http://d3bbxo4nelobc3.cloudfront.net/html/img/help/1300_05.jpg)

If you win from the Tenebris or satellite attacks and in occupation state, you can form a defense fleet to defend it.<br>

Federation members from Federations that occupying Tenebris or Satellites, can join the defense fleet.
The number of federation members who can join the defense fleet will be limited to seven.<br>

Defense commander can be transferred to another Federation member who is a part of the defense fleet.<br>


#### 4-1) NOTE

During Tenebris War (Includes Satillite battle) fleets will not be destroyed.<br>

The fleet that wins will automatically become the defense fleet and incoming rallies from the winning Federation will automatically return to their respective planets. It is advisable to immediately deploy additional support fleets during the occupation.<br>

When the Defensive Commander leaves and withdraws his fleet, the Defense Leader will automatically be delegated to the Commander with the highest combat ratings in the defensive fleet.<br>

When the defense fleet has been disbanded, the status of the occupation will be opened. 
If you withdraw the defense fleets before the support fleet arrives, it will no longer be occupied and will automatically be withdrawn even if the support fleet reached the Tenebris or satellites.<br>



### 5) Satellites Special Function

![](http://d3bbxo4nelobc3.cloudfront.net/html/img/help/1300_06.jpg)

#### 5-1) Satellite Bombarding

By occupying the satellites, you can attack the Tenebris’ defense fleet or other satellites with its ‘Satellite Bombarding’ skill.<br>

Satellite Bombarding skill can damage 1% (minimum number of damage = 1) of the defense fleet once every 60 seconds.<br>
Satellite Bombarding power increases depending on the charge level achieved by the Federation that occupies Tenebris.<br>

The target has to be the closest two satellites and Tenebris.<br>

Defending fleets do not automatically return even if all their defensive ships were damaged by the Satellite Bombarding skill.<br>

The Federation occupying Tenebris will not be able to use the Satellite Bombarding skill.<br>

※ When you use Satellite Bombarding skill to Tenebris or satellite when fleets are in a battle, no damages will be incurred from the skill.<br>


#### 5-2) Shield Effect

 If you are occupying both the Tenebris and satellite, the shield will be applied when Satellite Bombarding damage occurs.<br>

Shield effect will reduce the fleet damage incurred from Satellite Bombarding skill.
Depending on the number of occupied satellites, the reduction rate increases by 10%.<br>

The shield effect will be more powerful as much as the occupied satellites.<br>
