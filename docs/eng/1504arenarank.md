## Rank Grade

Rank grades are largely divided into Sailor, Skipper, Captain, Admiral, Astro, and Astro King, and these are further divided into three sub-division excluding Astro King.<br>

If you earn more than the ranking points required by each rank, you can achieve the corresponding rank grade.
 - Higher ranks of Admiral Ⅱ or higher require a certain level of achievement conditions in addition to the ranking points.<br>

Once the Sailor and Skipper ranks are reached, they will not drop or be demoted below the required Rank Points for that rank.
 - From the Captain rank, ranking points required by the level may drop, and if any of the requirements are not met, it will be demoted.<br>

When the season settlement is carried out which is every 4 weeks, all ranks higher than Admiral Ⅱ will be adjusted to Admiral Ⅲ, and the ranking points will also be adjusted to the corresponding ranking points required.
 - Ranking points of other ranks are also adjusted to the minimum.<br>
