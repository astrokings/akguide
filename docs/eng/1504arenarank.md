## Ranking Method

Rankings are determined according to the number of ranking points a player has.<br>

Rankings points can be earned or lost depending on the match battle result. 
 - Earned and lost ranking points may vary depending on the difference between your rankings and the opponent.<br>


## Rank Grade

Rank grades are largely divided into Bronze, Silver, Gold, Platinum, Astro, and Astro King, and these are further divided into three sub-division excluding Astro King.<br>

If you earn more than the ranking points required by each rank, you can achieve the corresponding rank grade.
 - Higher ranks of Platinum Ⅱ or higher require a certain level of achievement conditions in addition to the ranking points.<br>

Once the Bronze and Silver ranks are reached, they will not drop or be demoted below the required Rank Points for that rank.
 - From the Gold rank, ranking points required by the level may drop, and if any of the requirements are not met, it will be demoted.<br>

When the season settlement is carried out which is every 4 weeks, all ranks higher than Platinum Ⅱ will be adjusted to Platinum Ⅲ, and the ranking points will also be adjusted to the corresponding ranking points required.
 - Ranking points of other ranks are also adjusted to the minimum.<br>
