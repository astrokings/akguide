## Rank Grade

Grades are divided by [Total Grades] and [Competitive Grades].
 - Total Grade : [Sailer], [Skipper], [Captain], [Admiral]
 - Competitive Grade : [Astro], [Astro King]<br>
 - Besides Astro King, all grades are subdivided into three.<br>


### Total Grade

You can achieve the grade by collecting more than the ranking points that is required by each grade.
 - Once you obtain [Sailor], [Skipper] grades, you will not lose the grade. 
 - For [Captain] and [Admiral] ratings, if you fall below the ranking point, you can be downgraded. 
 - In [Captain] and [Admiral] grades, if you don't participate in Weekly competition, you can be downgraded. 
 - From the Total Grade, the highest grade is [Admiral I].
 - When the new season begins, the commander with [Admiral I] starts the season with the same score.<br>


### Competitive Grade

[Competitive Grade] is to find the strongest players of the season. 
 - [Competitive Grade] can be achieved by current season's ranking points and number of battles they had played.
 - Competitive Grades are specified by rank, and if you dropped out from the current grade, you will be downgraded to the previous total grade. 
 - [Competitive Grade] rewards are much more different than Total Grade rewards.
 - The Competitive Grade is operated by seasons and once new season starts, everything resets and gives new opportunities. 
 - When a new season starts, Commanders with Competitive Grades will change to the Total Grades.
