# Resource

### 1)Harvesting and Utilizing Resources

 You need resources to construct buildings, research projects, or build ships. They are essential in developing your planet. There are many ways to acquire resources.



### 2)Improving Resource Production

 You can improve resource production rate by developing the resource production facilities located in the eastern area of the planet.



### 3)Harvesting Resources

 You can deploy fleets to harvest resources from the Resource Sites dotting the space map.

The amount of resources available depends on the level of the Resource Site. To harvest all the resources available, you need a fleet with a vast cargo load.

When the resources on the site is depleted or the fleet cargo load is full, the fleet returns to the planet.

If the fleet assigned to harvest resources is attacked and defeated by the enemy, it will return to the planet.

 If you successfully raid a planet owned by an enemy, you can loot the resources on that planet.
