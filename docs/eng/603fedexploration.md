# Federation Exploration

 You can launch a Federation expedition with other members to explore the unknown territories and reap the rewards.. Each member of a Federation can dispatch a Hero to one of the expedition destinations.

The likelihood of such expeditions to succeed is calculated by the sum of the dispatched heroesâ€™ stats.

The expedition begins when the timer runs out or the number of participating heroes reaches the maximum. It takes some time for the expedition to return with reward.
