 The more resources you invest, the faster the project will be completed and you get more [***<u>Federation Contribution Points.</u>***](eng/607fedcontribution#Federation-Contribution)

Higher tier projects require a certain amount of lower projects completed.

You must be a member of a Federation to receive benefits from these projects.
