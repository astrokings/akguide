## Weekly Arena Setting

The battlefield in which the fleet war takes place is an environmental setting and it is switched sequentially at the time of weekly settlement.<br>

There are four Arena Settings available.
 - Star System : This is a general stellar system region considered as a normal arena setting with no special effects applied.
 - Meteoroids : This is an area with large-scale meteorite groups. Damage of cannon and missile weapons is reduced by 20% and the range of all weapon types is reduced by 50%.
 - Gaseous Nebula : An area surrounded by a gas nebula. The damage of the beam weapon is reduced by 20%.
 - Black Hole : This is an area where a black hole is located nearby. Damage of rail gun and missile weapons are reduced by -20% and the ship movement speed is increased by 20% during battle.<br>

The outcome of the battle may vary depending on the arena settings, forming a fleet based on the current arena setting for the week could give more advantage to win the battle.<br>



## Command Formation

A command formation is a strategic arrangement required for multiple fleets to be deployed.
  - It is a high-level concept of fleet formation.<br>

Command formations are largely divided into offensive, defensive, and mobility, providing effects and forming a mutual relationship.
 - The relationship between the command formation is as follows:<br>
    * Maneuver > Defense > Attack > Maneuver
 - Each formation has its own buff effect, and depending on the oppponent's formation, additional buffs or debuffs effect through match relationship is applied.<br>

To be provided with the buff effect for command formation, certain conditions must be met.
 - Each formation requires specific types of Flagship such as Striker, Guardian, or Tactician. Formation effects are only applied when the required Flagship is included in the fleet setup.<br>

Each formation has its own 'Tactic Operation' value in addition to the buff and debuff effect.
 - 'Tactic Operation' affects the priority each fleet needs to select an opponent fleet and battle.<br>
 


## Organize Fleet

To participate in the Empire Arena, a total of three fleets must be formed.
 - A total of three battles per match with three fleets.<br>

Freely organize your fleet within the limits of the size of your fleet formation.
 - You can organize your fleet regardless of the number of ships you currently own.
 - It is not possible to assign duplicate flagships or heroes in each fleet.
 - The ships are based on the highest tier you can currently produce, and the current enhancement level is applied.
 - All the enhancements, equipment, and buffs of flagships and ships on the commander's planet are applied except for external buffs.
 - Completing the fleet formation and registering for participation is necessary to be able to proceed with the battle.<br>

Enhancement, equipment, and buffs are saved based on the time of registration of the three fleets. 
 - Select registration and play based on the saved data.<br>
