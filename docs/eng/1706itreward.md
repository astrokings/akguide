## Contribution

Contribution Points are new goods in Interspace that are acquired and used separately from the Federation Contribution Points of the Galaxy.

Actions in Interspace are converted into 'Contribution Points' and paid to the commander.<br>
You can acquire it according to your contribution in battles occurring in Interspace, strengthening the defense fleet, occupying a sector, or succeeding in defense.<br>

Contribution points are accumulated after joining a faction, and when you leave the faction you joined, all the contribution points earned from that faction are reset.

Contribution points can be exchanged for 'Coins', a currency used in Interspace through the Faction Shop.<br>
You can collect coins to purchase items needed for growth in the shop.


## Contribution Rewards

If you succeed in capturing a sector or defending a sector occupied by your own faction from an enemy invasion, you can obtain additional rewards according to your battle contribution.

Contribution is ranked according to Contribution earned in battle.

If a sector is not captured within the time limit in the invasion state, the contribution rank is reset along with the sector state change.


## Battle Rewards

Battle rewards can be obtained during battles between expeditions and battles with the commander of the defense fleet stationed at the base.

As a battle reward, you gain the experience and contribution of the participating hero.

Battle rewards are calculated and paid according to the damaged ship.<br>
The more ship damage is done, the more contribution points are paid.


## Faction Occupancy Rewards

Every Wednesday, a faction member who achieves 100 or more weekly contribution points will receive an occupation rate reward.
