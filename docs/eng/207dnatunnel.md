# DNA Tunnel Effect

***As a result of the ongoing research by the flagship research consortium, it has been found that linking the genetic specificity between the crew members on board can significantly enhance the flagship effect.*** <br>
***Therefore, a system called the "DNA Tunnel System" was developed, which allows the "DNA Tunnel Effect" to be applied to certain flagships.***

To activate the DNA Tunnel Effect, various conditions must be met.

- Upgrade the flagship to tier 6
- Required crew member
- Additional conditions may be required depending on the flagship.

When all activation conditions are met, the unique DNA tunnel effect of the flagship will be activated.
