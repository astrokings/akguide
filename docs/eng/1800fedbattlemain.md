# Imperial Federation War

![](http://d3bbxo4nelobc3.cloudfront.net/html/img/help/1800_01.jpg)

***In the internal consortium of "Merchant Guild (E.M.U.)", it was suggested that there is a need for an opportunity for humanity, which is isolated throughout the galaxy, to unite as one and grow together. In response, the Merchant Guild cooperated with Interspace's "Empyrean Guild" to allow all galactic federations to participate, and held a friendly tournament named "Imperial Federation War".***

***In the Empyrean Guild, the technology of Interspace was introduced, and the "Cygnus Area", a black hole area, was constructed as a battlefield. In order to ensure stability in the Cygnus region, the gate is open only at the designated time, and you can enter the battlefield only for a short time, but you can fight with the federations of all galaxies.***

***Participate in Imperial Federation War to earn Merchant Guild rewards and make your Federation known across the galaxy!***
