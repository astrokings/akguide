### 1)Defeating Pirates

 A variety of rewards can be earned by defeating space pirates. Access your Inventory to check and use the rewards.

E.M.U. offers special rewards when you defeat each level of space pirates for the first time.

To increase the odds, scout the ship composition of the pirates and organize your fleet with ships that are [***<u>strong</u>***](eng/201normalship#Strengths-and-Weaknesses-of-Ship) against the majority of their ship type.

### 1)Hunting Wanted Criminals

You sometimes loot a [Wanted Poster] when you defeat space pirates. You can access the poster from your Inventory.

Unlike their mundane brethren, you must [***<u>manually control your fleet</u>***](eng/503fleetbattle#Fleet-Battle) when fighting wanted criminals. They disappear if you do not defeat them within a given time.

# Priora Squad

The Priora Squad, which appears outside the Tenebris area, is pirate squad composed of a powerful fleet called the Vigilante and several followers linked to the Vigilante.

Linked followers give a stronger effect to the Vigilante, and when the follower is defeated, the effect given to the Vigilante disappears.

You have to defeat the Vigilante to get a rare reward, and you can get more rewards if you defeat the Vigilante with a lot of connected followers.
