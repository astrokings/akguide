### 1)Defeating Pirates

 A variety of rewards can be earned by defeating space pirates. Access your Inventory to check and use the rewards.

E.M.U. offers special rewards when you defeat each level of space pirates for the first time.

To increase the odds, scout the ship composition of the pirates and organize your fleet with ships that are [***<u>strong</u>***](eng/201normalship#Strengths-and-Weaknesses-of-Ship) against the majority of their ship type.

# Wanted Criminals

### 1)Hunting Wanted Criminals

 Use [Wanted Posters] to locate wanted criminals and defeat them for valuable rewards.

You sometimes loot a [Wanted Poster] when you defeat space pirates. You can access the poster from your Inventory.

Unlike their mundane brethren, you must [***<u>manually control your fleet</u>***](eng/503fleetbattle#Fleet-Battle) when fighting wanted criminals. They disappear if you do not defeat them within a given time.
