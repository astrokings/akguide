***Recently, an unidentified fleet has appeared on the outskirts of the Thetmes Nebula, launching attacks on several settlements. This fleet employs weapons unlike any technology known to us, and their origins remain a mystery.***

***According to survivor testimonies and prisoner interrogations, these forces have been confirmed to hail from a parallel dimension. They claim their universe is on the brink of collapse due to the side effects of Cosment, and that the dimension rift connecting their world to ours was opened by the breakdown of dark matter.***

***Their objective is clear: to escape their dying dimension by conquering our world and reclaiming a stable future. In particular, they are targeting our Thonium technology, seeking to seize and weaponize it. Using Cosment-based weapon systems, they exhibit unique tactics and technologies never before seen—even in our conflicts with the CRUX.***

***But this invasion is more than a desperate bid for survival. They’ve already begun constructing forward bases and are mobilizing a massive fleet for full-scale war. This new threat could prove even more catastrophic than the CRUX conflict.***

***Commander, the time has come to defend our world from these interdimensional invaders. Humanity’s survival is at stake, and your leadership is more crucial than ever. Ready your fleet and prepare for battle!***
