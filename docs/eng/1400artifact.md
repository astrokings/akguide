# Artifact

Not long ago, a bunch of old relics was discovered from some of the planets that were restored by the CRUX.<br>
These 'Artifacts', made with ancient human technology, were hidden secretly by the emperor who feared that the power would leak before it was lost.<br>

Even though E.M.U.’s best scientists are researching the discovered ‘Artifacts’ with all their power, it is still impossible to restore the production technology.<br>
E.M.U. intends to enhance the strength of humanity against CRUX by providing some of the artifacts found and the technology to utilize them to some qualified commanders.<br>

Artifacts and the technology won’t be free, but the enormous power and potential value of these artifacts will be rewarded for whatever the cost is.<br>


## Artifact System

### Unlock

To use the Artifact System, you need to unlock the system.
You can unlock the Artifact System when you reach a certain level on each system.<br>

### Equip Artifact

Once the artifact system has been unlocked, you can check the details and equip artifacts on the system slots. 
There are general and core artifacts in which each Artifact System can be equipped with 3~6 regular artifacts and 1 core artifact.<br>

All artifacts can be obtained from wanted pirates, alien Fleet, and dimension rift rewards.<br>

### System Effect & Core Artifact Activation

When you equip all the artifacts on the Artifact System, some effects will be activated.
- You can have the effect of each system.
- Core artifact buff will be activated.

When the system effect is available, the 'Activate' button will be displayed and can be activated when you tap the button.
When the artifact system is in use or in cooldown time, you cannot unequip or replace the artifacts.<br>


Core artifact buffs are automatically applied when all artifacts are equipped on the system.<br>

If you have opened multiple artifact systems, you can use each system effect and core artifact buffs at the same time.<br>


### Artifact Level and Fusion

All the artifacts can be combined up to 10 levels. 
The system and core artifact effect is determined based on the lowest level of the installed artifact level.<br>

You can combine two artifacts of the same type and the same level to obtain one higher-level artifact.
If you have 4 or more artifacts with the same type and level, you can combine them more than once at the same time.<br>

Also, there is a fusion success rate and this determines the success or failure of the fusion.
You obtain one artifact with one level higher when it succeeds or obtain one same level artifact when it fails.<br>


## Artifact Inventory 

You can manage all the artifacts from the Artifact inventory.
Only artifacts that meet specific conditions can be selected and displayed, and detailed information on artifacts and fusion can also be processed in the inventory.<br>

An equipped artifact on a system does not show on the inventory.
You can only equip or replace the artifact from the Artifact System info page.<br>


## Unidentified Relic Research

You can obtain the Unidentified Relics when you defeat space pirates, wanted pirates, pirate base or dimension rift. 
Unidentified Relics has five levels and can obtain level 1 artifacts and level 1 core artifacts at random through research.<br> 

You can obtain 1 general or core artifact from a certain level of relics.
Also, artifacts associated with a particular system can acquire common artifacts and core artifacts that can be installed in the system.<br>

Relic research can be processed with one artifact at a time and requires research time. 
Research time depends on the relic level, and rewards will be given once the research time ends.<br> 


## Open Artifact 

You can obtain artifacts from the artifact open spot.<br>

Free Open activates every 8 hours and you can obtain level 1 general artifact or core artifact.<br>

From Regular Open you can obtain level 1 ~ level 5 general artifact or core artifact.
For Regular Open, you need an opening capsule and you can obtain the same number of artifacts as the consumed capsules.<br>
