# Manage Heroes & Recruit Hero

### 1)Manage Heroes

 Here, you can increase the level of your Heroes and their Skills or dismiss unnecessary Heroes.

<font color="red">**Note: Heroes dismissed or assigned to a council duty become inactive and are removed from the list.**</font>

<br>

### 2)Train Hero

 Rookie Heroes available at the Academy can be recruited at no cost.

As the facility gains levels, new trainings become available. A higher tier training course offers better Heroes.

### 3)Recruit Hero

 You can use Crystals to hire Veteran Heroes. The Recruit Hero list reveals only some information of the available Heroes.

If you do not like the Heroes currently offered, you can refresh the list.
