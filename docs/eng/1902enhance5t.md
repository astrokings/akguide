# T5 Flagship Equipment

- When upgrading flagship equipment to T5, the options that cannot be unlocked are determined according to the 'T4 SE equipment option values and probability'.
- For more information, please refer to the T4 SE Flagship Equipment Probability guide.

## SP Option Types and Probability

- The options granted to flagship equipment upgraded using the 'T5 Flagship Equipment Blueprint' are as follows, and all are granted with equal probability.
- Each probability is rounded to the third decimal place, so the sum of the displayed probabilities may not match 100% due to the rounded numbers, but the actual sum of individual probabilities is 100%.
- The bestowal probability for each option value is uniformly distributed.
  - Example: If there is an option with a minimum value of 1 and a maximum value of 100, the probability of receiving the option value 100 is 1%.
