# Strengths and Weaknesses of Ship

 Ships are the core element of a fleet that can be used to fight enemies or harvest resources.

There are four types of ships and each of them has its role, strengths, and weaknesses.

If you know the composition of an enemy fleet, send ships that are strong against them to defeat it more easily.

### 1)Frigate

 Frigates are small ships designed to penetrate the enemy formation and intercept large ships. They are strong against Battleships. While Frigates are small, agile, and cheap, they cannot withstand much damage.

The Rail Gun, their primary weapon, has a good range and excellent Penetration.

### 2)Destroyer

 Destroyers are medium ships designed to defend large ships from smaller targets such as Frigates.

These ships are equipped with beam weapons. Beam weapons are accurate, but they have a relatively short range and can be easily countered by high Beam Resistance.

### 3)Cruiser

 Cruisers are well-rounded medium ships that can deliver a devastating blow to Destroyers that are vulnerable to Missiles. 

Missile weapons boast a long range and excellent firepower, but they are not suitable for small, agile targets.

### 4)Battleship

 Theses large ships equipped with powerful long-range weapons dominate the battlefield.

Particle Cannons, their main weapons, have the longest range and most firepower, but have low rate of fire. They are ideal against Cruisers. 

For all their firepower, they cost a lot to build and repair.
