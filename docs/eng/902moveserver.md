# Move Server

#### 1) Permanent Server Transfer Application

 

If you meet the following conditions, you can apply to transfer to an adjacent server (galaxy) where transfers are allowed using the [Permanent Galaxy Transfer Pass]

 

- Command Center Level 12 or higher

- Commander account is at least 15 days old

 

Once the Tenebris controller of the server you applied to transfer to approves the transfer, the migration to that server will proceed.

 

Note : Migration is not possible if you are affiliated with a federation or have fleets deployed.

Note : You cannot join a federation while a server transfer application is in progress.

Note : After a server transfer, migration to another server is not possible for 30 days.

 

#### 2) Permanent Server Transfer Approval/Rejection

 

The Tenebris controller of each server can approve or reject galaxy transfer applications to their own server.

 

Note : Once a server transfer request is approved, it cannot be reversed, so please make your decision carefully.

Note : Server transfer applications are valid for 7 days and will be automatically rejected if not processed within this period.
