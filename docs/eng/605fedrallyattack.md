### 1)Rally Timer

 Participating fleets rally on the Joint Force Commander’s planet and launch together.

A rally has a timer. Players who want to participate must send their fleet before the timer runs out. When the timer runs out, the fleets gathered on the Joint Force Commander’s planet move to the target.

Fleets arrive after the timer ran out cannot participate in the attack.
