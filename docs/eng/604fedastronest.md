# Astronest

 Astronest is the Federation fortress that is built to control and secure the surrounding area. It offers a variety of features as well.

Players who are not a member of the federation cannot move their planet in the vicinity of Astronest. Other Federation fortresses cannot be built within its vicinity.

### 1)Construction and Withdrawal

 You can construct Astronest only after your Federation completes the [Construct Astronest] research project from the [***<u>Federation Research</u>***](602fedresearch.md) menu.

<font color="red">**Note: You cannot construct your Astronest near someone else’s Astronest.**</font>



If necessary, you can relocate your Astronest with the [Withdraw Astronest] item.

You do not lose the resources stored in the Astronest even when you relocate and reconstruct your Astronest.

When reconstructing destroyed or withdrawn Astronest, all the techs available through Federation Research will be automatically applied to your new Astronest.



### 2)Deposit Resource

 Federation Members may deposit resources to the shared resource pool of their Astronest.

The resources stored in Astronest may be accessed at any time as long as the fortress is intact.

### 3)Damaged Astronest and Repairing

 As your Astronest is a juicy target for enemies, it should be protected by researching defensive techs via the Federation Research menu or using the [Astronest Shield] item.

If the HP of your Astronest is reduced to 0, it ceases to function and loses some of the resources and ships within.

If you do not repair damaged Astronest in time, it is completely destroyed and disappears from the map.

If your Astronest is destroyed, you lose the zone of control and others may construct their Astronest there.

Of course, you can reconstruct a new Astronest. The resources that were stored in the previous Astronest become available again once you construct a new one.



### 4)Astronest Defense and Support Fleet

 When your Astronest is under attack, the fleets of your Federation Leader engage the attackers by default.

If there is a Federation Member whose fleets are stronger than the leaders’, the leader may assign the guard duty to that member.

When the Astronest is under attack, the fleets on the guard duty automatically jump in and join the battle and return to their original base once the battle is over.

Federation Members may send support fleets to defend their Astronest.



### 5)Scan Alien Fleets

 When Federation Members donate a certain amount of Dimensional Energy, the Astronest can reveal the location of the Alien Fleet for attack. 

Anyone Federation Members who join the raid and defeat the aliens during the scan receive reward. If your Federation fails to defeat the Alien Fleet, they will retaliate.

You have a chance to harvest some Dimensional Energy when defeating space pirates.
