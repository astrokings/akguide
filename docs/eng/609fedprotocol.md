# Federation Protocol

Federation Protocol Systems have been developed utilizing Alien Relics obtained from Alien Fleet battles.<br>
Federation Protocol is a useful system that provides Federation resources and grant various buffs to all Federation members for a certain period of time.<br>
Since each protocol has different effects and costs, it is important to consider wisely what is most needed for the Federation.<br>

<br>

### 1) How to start Federation Protocol

To enter the Federation Protocol Menu, Federation Protocol Research must be completed.<br>
Once the Research level 1 is achieved, the Federation Protocol Menu will be opened and ready for entry.

<br>

### 2) Unlock Federation Protocol

Federation Protocols are initially locked, and each protocol must be unlocked before it can be activated.

To unlock Federation Protocol, you need a special item called the Alien Relics.

<br>

### 3) Alien Relics

Alien Relics always require a certain amount of time when unlocking, activating and upgrading Federation Protocols.

Alien Relics can be obtained through Federation Expeditions, Federation Alien Fleet and Pirate Base attacks.<br>
The Alien Relics obtained by each Federation member should be donated to the Federation and used as Federation resources.<br>
Contribution Points can be earned by donating Alien Relics.

### 5) Federation Protocol Activation and Upgrades

Federation resources and Alien Relics are required to activate Federation Protocols.<br>
Each Protocol has a different duration therefore, the buff effect is retained only during that time.

When the buff duration has expired after the activation, it enters the cooldown state. It cannot be activated during this period.

If the Protocol is activated, Protocol upgrades can be performed.<br>
Upgrading the Protocol requires more Federation Resources and Alien Relics than activation.<br>
Protocol's buff effects increase as you upgrade.

### 6) 'Favor' Function

'Favor' function is used as a voting system for Federation Protocols.

This function makes it easy to determine the preferred Protocol by the Federation members.

When the Protocol is activated, the 'Favor' vote count will be reset.

'Favor' function is not available if the Protocol has not been activated or unlocked.

### 7) Activate Multiple Federation Protocols

In the initial state, only one Federation Protocol can be activated at a time.<br>
