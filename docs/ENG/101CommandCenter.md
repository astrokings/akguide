# 1.National Policy

## 1)Select National Policy

 You can set the general direction of planetary improvements by selecting a National Policy. Each policy offers two opposite options. If you select either, the items from the other cannot be accessed until National Policy is reset.

Once you decided a National Policy, you can enforce sub policies for buffs. Enforcing a policy costs some Policy Points.

 All spent Policy Points are refunded when National Policies are reset.











# 2.Council

 5개 분야의 위원회는 각기 전문화된 특수 효과를 발휘하며, 그 효과는 각각의 위원회에 귀속된 영웅의 수에 따라 점차 증가됩니다.



## 1)Improving Council

 Each council can be improved by assigning more Heroes to it.

Select a council and then a Hero to assign to that council. You can assign multiple Heroes at once.

**Note: Heroes assigned to a council can never become active again. They are effectively retired.**
