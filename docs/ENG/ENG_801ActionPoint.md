# 1.Action Point

 Deploying fleets to defeat space pirates or Alien Fleets costs you some Action Points.

Spent Action Points are slowly regenerated. You can instantly recover Action Points by using certain items.

Harvesting resources or raiding other players' planets does not cost Action Points.
